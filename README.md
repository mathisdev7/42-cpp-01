# CPP Module 01

![Final Score](https://i.ibb.co/vvxBwnMy/image.png)

## Project Description
The `CPP Module 01` builds upon the foundations set in Module 00, introducing more advanced concepts such as memory allocation, references, and file streams. The objective is to deepen the understanding of object-oriented programming and enhance proficiency in C++ syntax and features.

## Journey
This module was an exciting challenge as it required a deeper grasp of memory management and references. Unlike the first module, I successfully completed it on my first attempt, demonstrating a stronger understanding of C++ fundamentals and best practices.

## Key Learnings
- Understanding and using references and pointers
- Dynamic memory allocation with `new` and `delete`
- Introduction to file streams (`ifstream`, `ofstream`)
- Handling input and output more efficiently
- Dealing with class destructors and proper memory cleanup

## Technical Details
- Implemented programs that focus on memory handling and file operations.
- Practiced proper resource management to prevent memory leaks.
- Strengthened understanding of C++'s reference and pointer mechanisms.
- Applied OOP principles to enhance code structure and readability.

## Project Status
- **First Attempt**: Success
- **Completion Time**: 1 day per module

## Challenges Faced
- Managing dynamic memory correctly to avoid leaks.
- Understanding the behavior of references versus pointers.
- Handling file input and output efficiently.

## Reflection
This module solidified my confidence in using C++ efficiently. Learning how to handle memory correctly and work with file streams was a significant step toward mastering the language. The hands-on experience provided valuable insight into proper resource management.

## Skills Developed
- Advanced memory management
- Reference and pointer handling
- File input/output operations
- Debugging and resource optimization
- Strengthening C++ best practices
